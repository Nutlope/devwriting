### Idea tier list

- S tier: do interesting things offline and announce them or topics that will be popular no matter what
- A tier: provide insights and state quotable opinions (thought-leading)
- B tier: doing work for others - aggregating content, making a newsletter, or analyzing other people's work
- C tier: self-serving, all the rest of the content that people usually tell you to do when you're trying to write

### Formats

Formats - Straightforward but address the primary concern - The Guide to Remote Work That Isn't Trying to Sell You Anything - How to Get Rich (without getting lucky) - How to Market Yourself (without Being a Celebrity) - Superlatives: An interesting story about the first/last/best/worst experience when you did X. You see a lot of these in Rachelbythebay's work ([https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&qu...](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&query=https%3A%2F%2Frachelbythebay.com%2F&sort=byPopularity&type=story)) . Mtlynch focuses more on documenting his journey semi-realtime ([https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&qu...](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&query=mtlynch.io&sort=byPopularity&type=story)) - Data & News: This is a lot of work but collect data for yourself and publish it for others and others will find that useful. - This is the strategy I am adopting for AI stuff [https://lspace.swyx.io/p/open-source-ai](https://lspace.swyx.io/p/open-source-ai). - Dan Luu does this a lot to back up his work [https://danluu.com/](https://danluu.com/) - Performance porn always - The cutting edge of data is news, and you can see this on Gergely's substack ([https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/)) but you're basically a journalist at that point - How $POPULAR_THING Works: This is Fly.io's ([https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&que...](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&query=fly.io%20sqlite&sort=byPopularity&type=story)) and Alex Xu's strategy [https://blog.bytebytego.com/](https://blog.bytebytego.com/)

- Listicle works well :).. but an organized listicle is an overview
  - Overviews: What your part of the dev ecosystem looks like to you. It'll never be perfect, it can't be. Some folks on HN will tear you to shreds for missing something obvious. But it will be immensely helpful to people just behind you in experience. See: How I write backends ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22106482](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22106482)), The evolution of the data engineer ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33317126](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33317126)), and my AWS vs Cloudflare post ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28903982](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28903982)). Overviews become "Insights" when you can successfully reframe something in a new light that is useful for people to understand what is going on.
  - Predictions/Wishlists: What is missing from your part of the ecosystem. The complement of the above. You can also invert it into a complaint post, like [https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/](https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/) or [https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2...](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f) but those are less constructive if entertaining
  - Principles: Timeless things, a superset of the previous two points. See rauchg (Nextjs cocreator - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8559519](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8559519)) and dan abramov (react core team - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18792373](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18792373)
