- The Craft of Writing Effectively - [1.5hr talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&feature=emb_title), [summary](https://www.robincussol.com/the-craft-of-writing-effectively-summary/)
- Ship 30 for 30: [How to Start Writing Online](https://www.ship30for30.com/post/how-to-start-writing-online-the-ship-30-for-30-ultimate-guide)
- Julian Shapiro’s [Writing Handbook](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)

## Module 1 Exercises

1. ​What is one tech (large or small) that has changed your life?
2. ​What are you weirdly expert about outside of work?
3. ​What blogpost or article is permanently stuck in your head?

# Module 2

This module is focused on thoughtleading, writing formats, and SEO.

## Module 2 Readings

- [How to thought lead](https://github.com/sw-yx/brain/blob/master/A%20-%20Writing/Draft%20-%20How%20To%20Thought%20Lead.md)
- [Professional Blogging](https://andrewchen.com/professional-blogging/)

### Idea tier list

- S tier: do interesting things offline and announce them or topics that will be popular no matter what
- A tier: provide insights and state quotable opinions (thought-leading)
- B tier: doing work for others - aggregating content, making a newsletter, or analyzing other people's work
- C tier: self-serving, all the rest of the content that people usually tell you to do when you're trying to write

### Writing formats

- Straightforward but address the primary concern
- The Guide to Remote Work That Isn't Trying to Sell You Anything
- How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)
- How to Market Yourself (without Being a Celebrity)
- Superlatives: An interesting story about the first/last/best/worst experience when you did X. You see a lot of these in [Rachelbythebay's work](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&query=https://rachelbythebay.com/&sort=byPopularity&type=story). [Mtlynch](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&query=mtlynch.io&sort=byPopularity&type=story) focuses more on documenting his journey semi-realtime.
- **Data & News:** This is a lot of work but collect data for yourself and publish it for others and others will find that useful.
  - This is the strategy I am adopting for [AI stuff](https://lspace.swyx.io/p/open-source-ai).
  - Dan Luu does this a lot to back up his work [https://danluu.com/](https://danluu.com/)
  - Performance porn always
  - The cutting edge of data is news, and you can see this on [Gergely's substack](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/) but you're basically a journalist at that point
- How $POPULAR_THING Works: This is [Fly.io's](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&query=fly.io%20sqlite&sort=byPopularity&type=story) and [Alex Xu's strategy](https://blog.bytebytego.com/)
- Listicle works well :).. but an organized listicle is an overview
  - Overviews: What your part of the dev ecosystem looks like to you. It'll never be perfect, it can't be. Some folks on HN will tear you to shreds for missing something obvious. But it will be immensely helpful to people just behind you in experience. See: [How I write backends](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22106482), [The evolution of the data engineer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33317126), and my [AWS vs Cloudflare post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28903982). Overviews become "Insights" when you can successfully reframe something in a new light that is useful for people to understand what is going on.
  - Predictions/Wishlists: What is missing from your part of the ecosystem. The complement of the above. You can also invert it into a complaint post, like [this](https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/) or [this](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f) but those are less constructive if entertaining
  - Principles: Timeless things, a superset of the previous two points. See [rauchg](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8559519) (Nextjs co-creator) and [dan abramov](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18792373) (react core team)
  - "Beat up the biggest guy in the prison" https://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/
  - Meme
  - https://www.swyx.io/cfp-advice#pick-a-genre

## Module 2 Exercises

1. [Microcopy Exercise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/151YYn0KuWAcgY6Am1FeA0mGWnFgiTFu-mqpArU3k2tE/edit#) from Philip Kiely
2. Come up with 3 article ideas, and write 3 titles each

## Module 4 Exercises

1. Visualize/Illustrate 1-3 of your articles/ideas, using Excalidraw, tldraw.com, or other tool of choice. If you need inspiration, illustrate someone else's essay!
2. Schedule 3 social media posts promoting the same article, on Typefully or Buffer. Do not repeat yourself. Use your visuals if it helps!
3. Start a newsletter (Revue, Substack, Convertkit, Buttondown. Hashnode has basic newsletter functionality as well). If you have one already, take some tactics from the reading and apply them for your next issue.
4. Start a writing infra repo. Add timeline, reference list, key tools, list communities, recommended reads.
